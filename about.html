            <h1>About the website</h1>
            <p>
                This website is a demonstration of the use of the
                <a href="https://https://frasercs.pythonanywhere.com/"
                    >Demonstrative Diagnosis API</a
                >
                to diagnose an animal's condition based on the signs they are
                presenting."
            </p>

            <h2>About the API</h2>

            <p>
                The API is a RESTful API that uses a Bayes model to diagnose an
                animal's condition based on the signs they are presenting. The
                API is hosted on
                <a href="https://www.pythonanywhere.com/">PythonAnywhere</a> and
                is written in Python using the
                <a href="https://flask.palletsprojects.com/en/2.0.x/">Flask</a>
                framework. Other libraries used include
                <a href="https://flask-restx.readthedocs.io"> Flask-RESTX </a>,
                <a href="https://openpyxl.readthedocs.io/">openpyxl</a> and
                <a href="https://flask-cors.readthedocs.io/en/latest/"
                    >Flask-CORS</a
                >. The API is documented using
                <a href="https://swagger.io/">Swagger</a> which is automatically
                generated via Flask-RESTX.
            </p>

            <h2>About the website</h2>

            <p>
                The website is written in HTML, CSS and JavaScript. The website
                uses the
                <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/">Bootstrap</a> framework to
                provide a responsive layout. The website is hosted on
                <a href="https://www.netlify.com/">Netlify</a>.
            </p>

            <h3>A deeper look at the website</h3>

            <p>
                To make use of the functionality of the API, I used JavaScript's
                <a
                    href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Fetch_API"
                    >Fetch API</a
                >
                to make requests to the API. The API returns a JSON object which
                is then parsed and displayed on the page.
            </p>
            <p>
                I utilise the endpoints provided by the API to get the list of
                signs and diseases as well as the valid animals. This allows me
                to dynamically generate the list of signs and diseases on the
                page. This means that if the API is updated with new signs or
                diseases, the website will automatically update to reflect this.
            </p>
            <p>
                I make use of the WikiData IDs provided via the api by creating
                links to the WikiData page for the sign and disease. This allows
                the user to learn more about the condition as well as translate
                it to their native language.
            </p>
            <p>
                I use JavaScript to dynamically generate the HTML for the page.
                This allows me to easily change what is on the screen depending
                on what data I have received from the API calls.
            </p>
            <h3>Using Likelihoods</h3>
            <p>
                I added the ability to alter likelihoods and perform totally
                diagnosis quite late into the cycle and as such the website
                doesn't use that feature. Without designing it myself, it's hard
                to say what the best way to implement this may be, but possibly
                using a separate page to edit the priors and likelihood values
                would be a good idea. This would allow the user to change the
                likelihoods and priors before providing the sign data on a
                separate page to keep it readable, as editing a table that is 15
                rows long and 15 columns wide would be quite difficult if it was
                crammed into a single page with the sign data too.
