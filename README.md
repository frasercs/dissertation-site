# Website

The website uses Bootstrap 5 to style all elements of the page, the most up to date version of Bootstrap's documentation at the time of writing this can be found here: https://getbootstrap.com/docs/5.2/getting-started/introduction/\.

To run the website locally you can open up the HTML files as all of them are referenced by path, meaning the whole site should work without any need for deployment.

If you do wish to deploy the website, I followed a guide from 'freeCodeCamp' at https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/publish-your-website-netlify-github/\. As I used Github to store my code and as source control, all I had to do was link the repository to Netlify and it automatically redeploys every time I make changes.
